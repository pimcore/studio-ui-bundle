# Pimcore Studio's Storybook

Welcome to our Storybook! This is where we document all our React components.  
Storybook helps us build, test, and showcase our components in isolation, ensuring they work as expected.

## Structure

- **Components**: Contains purely presentational components that are used in the application.
- **Tools**: Contains Tools that help with the daily work.
- **Modules**: Contains the primary business logic of the different features.
